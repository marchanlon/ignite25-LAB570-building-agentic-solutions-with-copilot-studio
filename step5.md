Help me process a warranty claim for customer Alex Morgan. Address: 123 Maple Lane, Tulsa, OK 74104. Product: Zava Backpack (SKU BP-010) purchased from Zava Online on 2025-08-22, order A12876. After two commutes the main zipper pull detached; the teeth misaligned and the main compartment won't close. Used under normal conditions.

Watch the Test your agent panel and notice how the agent calls the Warranty Claim Processor Prompt, pulls in knowledge and calls the flow. Since it's using generative AI, your response may vary. The important thing is to confirm you see the Auto Approval Claims action get called in the Test your agent panel and you get a response. Feel free to test a different scenario where the purchase date is not within the warranty period, say 2024-09-30, and verify that you get a different outcome.

Congratulations! You've now built and tested an Order Management Agent in Copilot Studio that can pull from knowledge, consume and write to internal data through MCP and integrates with AI Prompts and Agent Flows.
